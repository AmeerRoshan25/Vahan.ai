# **App Name**: ScholarAI

## Core Features:

- User Authentication: Implements a user interface with sign-up and sign-in options on the first page. New users provide their name, phone number, and password.  User details are stored to a JSON file. Existing users can sign in.
- Topic Input and Questions: Allows the user to enter a topic and related information, and to ask questions about the topic.
- Research Engine: Researches capabilities to gather information from web content, video transcripts and academic sources. Research can be simulated by reading content from local text files or other static resources.
- Interactive Questioning System: Uses AI to ask clarifying questions to the user, determining their specific interests, prior knowledge, and preferred learning formats, in order to personalize the educational content.
- Report Generation: Generates a structured educational report that includes a clear organization, visual aids (using placeholder images), citations, references, and recommended resources.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A calming blue (#3498db) to promote focus and learning.
- Secondary color: A clean white (#ffffff) for readability and a modern feel.
- Accent color: A vibrant green (#2ecc71) to highlight key information and calls to action.
- Clean, well-organized layout with clear sections for each part of the learning process.
- Use simple, intuitive icons to represent different topics and functions.
- Subtle animations and transitions to provide feedback and guide the user through the application.

## Original User Request:
here in first page both option need to be sign up for new user and sign in for execiting user new user fill the details like name and phone number and password etc and after that the information will be stored in the backend and you need to take that infornation while siging afeter succesfully signing the user can enter the topic can tell about the topic and asking question final generationg report Candidate Description
Create an AI-powered learning system that conducts deep research on a specific topic, asks clarifying
questions to tailor the content, and generates comprehensive educational reports with citations.
Problem Statement: Self-directed learning often requires extensive research across multiple sources
with little personalization. Build a system that conducts thorough research on a topic, personalizes the
learning experience through interaction, and delivers comprehensive, well-structured educational
content.
Requirements:
1. Build a system that accepts learning topics and user learning objectives
2. Implement research capabilities to gather information from:
○ Web content (simulated or API-based)
○ Video transcripts (simulated or API-based)
○ Academic sources (simulated or API-based)
3. Create an interactive questioning system to:
○ Clarify user's specific interests within the topic
○ Determine prior knowledge level
○ Identify preferred learning formats
4. Generate comprehensive, structured educational reports with:
○ Clear organization and learning progression
○ Visual aids and diagrams
○ Citations and references
○ Recommended additional resources
5. Support report modifications based on follow-up questions and feedback
Expected Deliverables:
1. Working prototype with research and report generation capabilities
2. Source code with clear documentation
3. Sample topics and generated reports
4. README file explaining:
○ Setup instructions
○ System architecture
○ Research methodology
○ Personalization approach
○ Report generation and modification implementation

○ Limitations and future improvements
General Submission Guidelines
1. Code Repository: Submit your code through a GitHub/GitLab repository
2. Documentation: Include clear README and inline code documentation
3. Setup Instructions: The application should be able to set up and launch in no more than 2
commands - dockerization is recommended
4. Demo: Include screenshots or a brief video demonstration if possible
5. Time Management: The assignment is designed to be completed in approximately 12 hours
6. Focus Areas: Prioritize core functionality over visual polish or edge cases
7. Technology Choices: You may use technologies of your choice but be prepared to justify your
selections
8. Sample input output : Add sample input and output in the submissions
Remember that this assignment is meant to showcase your:
● Problem-solving approach
● Engineering implementation skills
● LLM integration capabilities
● Software design decisions
● Technical communication
We value working solutions with thoughtful architecture over perfect implementations. Good luck!
